# SC1015_Predict_Experience\

Prerequisites: Dataset Selection
What dataset will you be working on? One good source of datasets is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets where you may find interesting projects to work on
Try to find interesting datasets where you can formulate meaningful tasks
Try to find tabular/structured datasets instead of images(CV) or text(NLP).
Checkpoint 1. Introduction
Detailed introduction to your project objective, e.g. what problem you are going to solve based on what dataset.

Briefly review the significance of your topic, e.g. any potential applications of your project.

Summarize the organization of your report, e.g. in Section xx we do xx.

Checkpoint 2. Data Preprocessing
Detailed description on your dataset via statistics and visualization.

Detailed statements on why and how you perform data preprocessing, e.g. data cleaning, normalization, transformation, data augmentation.

Checkpoint 3. Methodology
Explain the reason for choosing your machine learning model.

Detailed & formal introduction to your model. You must provide the formulation or diagram of the model you use thoroughly. Clarify the input and output of your model.

Clarify how you train and inference based on the model you choose.

Clarify the choice of hyperparameters of your model.

Checkpoint 4. Experiments
Detailed introduction to the performance metrics you use for experiments.

Briefly introduce which baselines you are comparing with, e.g. you compare your model against a random guessing, a decision tree, a linear model, etc. This part is compulsory.

Detailed model selection and comparison: Is your model fitting well compared to your baselines? Discuss about underfitting/overfitting if any. Important

Which configuration (hyperparameter choices) performs the best? What numerical results lead to these conclusions? Your conclusion is held in what sense? The analysis of this part (not the performance alone) is the most important.

Checkpoint 5. Conclusion
Briefly summarize your findings in Experiments.

The limitation of your current model. How you can improve your model.
